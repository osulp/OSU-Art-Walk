She was an artist-in-residence in 1984 at Seattle’s Pilchuck Glass School, and it was there that she began experimenting with fusing and slumping, a process she has described as time consuming: “Plate glass is initially cut into shapes and forms using a common hand-held glass cutter. These pieces are then arranged in a large kiln and heated to a temperature where the glass becomes relatively soft and starts to bend and slump. At a slightly higher temperature, the various glass layers fuse together to become one solid piece of glass. The glass is then cooled (annealed) very slowly, which takes anywhere from four to ten days. At the end of this long wait, the kiln is opened and success or failure is confronted.” She now almost exclusively creates with glass on a larger scale, though her printmaking background shows in her many designs that incorporate photography.
