This term was new to me, and referred to all the information that has been collected, but may not be readily available to scientists and society. When scientists study a complex system, the task of including all the past and current data that might shed light on a research question seems daunting. My painting, of Lookout Creek in the Andrews Forest, is an attempt to illustrate the challenge of bringing dark data to the light. The stream course had been disrupted by earth movements, so recently dead trees are present in the flowing water. The color portions of the painting represent areas where researchers are studying an aspect of the ecosystem, but their work does not connect. A second painting in full color represents a world where collaboration connects many fields of study, thus giving the most color and value to the work. I have also thought that to many people, most science is 'dark data' and the job of science educators is to help illuminate the data and make it meaningful to citizens.

Pauling's contributions to the understanding of molecular structures and his anti-war activism were pivotal accomplishments of the 20th century. Using imagery to portray the unseen complexity of the invisible atomic world in a living and organic way was a key consideration in the pieces. Tree-like 'ball and stick' configurations undulate and move as the viewer walks by. Large helix-like shapes dominate interior landscapes. Color was used to evoke a sense of peacefulness, and a general sense of order is pulled from complexity. A lantern-shaped paper ball based on Pauling's molecular models floats in 'Opposite and Equal.' This ball is also the unfolded version of a Japanese oragami swan, a peace symbol paying tribute to Pauling's peace activism. These works utilize lenticular optics to create an illusion of depth and movement as viewers engage the pieces. This opens a window into a space quite apart from the surrounding environment.

They celebrate overlooked, undervalued, or threatened Northwest native wildflower species in the hope of increasing awareness and appreciation. Each of the plants portrayed has a special link with the human history of the region...Here is perhaps the most celebrated West Coast wildflower. Called Copa de Oro by the earliest Hispanic inhabitants, this golden poppy once emblazoned such vast fields that its brilliant color was visible from sailing ships miles offshore -- a plausible basis for the early name La Tierra del Fuego, land of fire. Discouraged by grazing, agriculture, and development, it now blooms in lesser abundance, May-September, from Southern California north to the Columbia River, and elsewhere escaped from garden plantings. This marvelous perennial arises from a deep taproot and generally reaches two feet in height. The flowers are two to three inches across and vary from pale to deep yellow and orange. They are remarkably responsive to sunlight, closing at nightfall or in overcast weather. Sepals are united in a conical structure that is thrust off by the opening petals, much like doffing a little hat. The seed capsule is linear and tipped by the withering styles. The foliage is grayish-green and finely divided.E. Californica owes its introduction to the botanical world to three explorer naturalists and a coincident Russian. Archibald Menzies, Scottish botanist and surgeon with Captain George Vancouver, was first to collect specimens for transport to foreign shores, in Monterey in December if 1792. But his classification was incorrect, his collection suffered badly on shipboard, and the plants delivered to Kew Gardens soon died. Next was Adelbert van Chamisso, French naturalist with the Russian Romanoff expedition, spending October of 1816 at San Francisco. Here he collected, described, classified, and named Eschscholtzia californica after the ship's noble young surgeon, Johann Friedrich Escholtz. Finally, it came to David Douglas, Scottish botanist and practical gardener, to convey this vibrant poppy to the world. Collecting along the Multnomah (Willamette) River in 1825, he first encountered E. colifornica and sent back to the Horticultural Society of London the seeds that thrived in English gardens and beyond.""",TRUE,FALSE

Each of the plants portrayed has a special link with the human history of the region.”Information provided by Hall on Trilliums: Trillium ovatum. Western Trillium or Wake-robin.While other vegetation is still winter-bare, this elegant blossom unfurls in its whorl of large sessile leaves to punctuate moist shay woods from British Columbia south to Central California, from lowlands to well up in the mountains. Indeed, one of its common names, Wake-robin, implies that it precedes the earliest of birds. The Latin generic name Trillium, meaning triple, is appropriate to describe the parts of three in petals, sepals, and leaves - all supported by a sturdy bare stem as much as 12 inches tall. This species is distinguished from another common woodlawn trillium in having a thin stem or pedicel that bears each solitary flower above its three broad net-veined leaves. The fragrant white flowers of T. ovatum turn purplish with age.The botanical history of this plant is tied to the history of the pacific Northwest via Lewis and Clark Expedition. On their return trip east in 1806, Captain Meriwether Lewis collected it ""on the rapids of Columbia river"", one of the 150 novel specimens he conveyed to botanist Fredrick Pursh. It was from the Lewis collection that Trillium ovatum was first described and named by Pursh in his Flora Americae Septenrionalis of 1814, the first account of North American plants to include the Pacific Northwest.The familiar admonition not to pick trilliums is well founded. Removing the flower stem robs the rhizome of the food supply necessary to produce next year's plant, and some years may be required for recovery. Trilliums do not transplant well, but may grow from seed with patience. As many as seven years may pass before a white blossom is produced to crown the three stem-leaves. Ants are a natural aid in dispersal, attracted by sweet tissue on the seeds.",TRUE,FALSE

Each of the plants portrayed has a special link with the human history of the region.”Information provided by Hall on Camas: Camassia Leichtlinii. Large Camas.The Indian name quamash or camass persists in this 1-2' tall perennial arising from deep-seated bulb. Flowers vary anywhere from white to deep blue or violet. Camassia Leichlinii, the larger of our two common species, is distinguished by the withering petals twisting together above the seed capsule rather than falling separately. It ranges west of the Cascades from southern British Columbia to southern Oregon and into Sierran California.The starchy bulb of the camas was a prized staple for the native tribes in the Northwest. Care was required to avoid poisonous bulbs of another lily, the so-called death camas. Gathering camas root was the incentive for annual festivities, migrations to harvest ground where women dug and prepared bulbs (while the men engaged in sport and games). Handles of their digging sticks, fashioned from bone or antler, can be seen in museum collections. The sticks themselves, made of fire-hardened wood crooked and fattened at the end, have not survived so well.To prepare the root it was first cooked, either roasted elaborately in covered pits lined with hot stones, or boiled. It was then crushed in mortars and the gummy mass pressed into slabs for keeping. Hungry fur trapper Alexander Henry, in the Willamette Valley in 1814, tells in is diary of trading blue beads with the Kalapuyans for slabs of the nutritious food.

99,"Kincaids Lupine","screen print","fifth floor, central",,"Public",,,"part of The Valley Library's Northwest Art Collection, part of artist's Northwest Wildflowers series","On the pieces in OSU’s Valley Library, Hall has said, “These pieces are contemporary renditions in the classic tradition of botanical illustration, which communicates, in an artful manner, as much information as possible about a given plant. They celebrate overlooked, undervalued, or threatened Northwest native wildflower species in the hope of increasing awareness and appreciation. Each of the plants portrayed has a special link with the human history of the region.”Info provided by Hall on Kincaids Lupine: Lupinus sulphureus kincaidii.Our native lupines are a confusing lot, with nearly 600 distinct kinds described in the US. Within a given population bewildering variations occur, and rather free interbreeding compounds the confusion. One iridescent blue butterfly is not confused however. Known to prefer Kincaid's lupine as a larval food plant, the Fender's Blue butterfly, Icaricia icariodes fenderi, was last seen in 1931 and presumed extinct. But careful scrutiny of populations of Kincaid's lupine led to recent rediscovery of the rare insect. Now efforts are underway to protect both the butterfly and its host lupine.This variation of the sulphur lupines is confined to remnant bits of native prairie grasslands in western Oregon and Washington, primarily in the Willamette Valley. Lupines are broadly recognized by radiating leaflets and blossoms that resemble those of other members of the pea family. Kincaid's lupine may be distinguished by three characteristics: relatively low-growing basal leaves dominated by upbranched stems bearing uncrowded whorls of smallish flowers, blossoms a varied assortment of colors from yellow to blue to purple, and banner petals with a distinctly ruffled border.The name of Trevor Kincaid, as this lupine, has been ascribed to much of the flora and fauna of the Pacific Northwest. My first encounter was in the subject of my Master's thesis, a tiny aquatic fly that bears his name as original taxonomist (Maruina lanceolata Kincaid). Born in 1872, Kincaid grew up an avid student of nature, making prodigious collections of plant and animal specimens even before entering the fledgling University of Washington in 1894. Within seven years he was head of the Department of Zoology there and continued as inspired teacher, entomologist, and international science adviser until his death at 97, having shaped the early development of zoology at the university.",TRUE,FALSE

They celebrate overlooked, undervalued, or threatened Northwest native wildflower species in the hope of increasing awareness and appreciation. Each of the plants portrayed has a special link with the human history of the region.” Hall provided the following information on this piece: ""Iris tenax. Tough-threaded Iris, Purple Iris, or Flag.This showy little wild iris, occurring in many shades of purple, is common in neglected fields and roadsides in the Willamette Valley in early spring. It was introduced into the formal world of botany by that intrepid Scot, David Douglas, the exploring naturalist whose name id commemorated in the Douglas-fir.Douglas made the harrowing voyage to northwest America in 1824 under protection of the Hudson's Bay Company, to collect specimens for the Horticultural Society of London. He found this iris ""a common plant in North California, and along the coast of New Georgia, in dry soils or open parts of woods, flowering in April and May."" From Material sent by Douglas, John Lindley, Professor of Botany in the University of London, wrote the original description in 1829: 'A plant forming close tufts of rigid, erect, linear-ensiform, evergreen, tough leaves, which in wild specimens are rather shorter than the flowers. Stem erect, a foot or rather more high, angular, leafy, clothed at the base with remains of the leaves, as in Allium Victorialis. Ovarium on a long stalk, not enclosed within the floral leaves, somewhat 3-cornered. Flowers about the size of Iris virginica, sessile on the ovarium, dark purple, veiny; the outer petals obovate, acuminate, spreading, beardless; the inner obovate, rounded, erect, shorter than the others. Stigmas 2-lobed, short.' Iris, the Greek word for rainbow, was applied to this genus for its variety of color. The Latin species name tenax (tenacious) derives from these observations made by Douglas on uses of the plant:""The native tribes about Aguilar (Umpqua) river...find this plant very serviceable for many purposes: from the veins of the leaves fine cord is made, which is converted into fishing nets; and from its buoyancy, great strength, and durability, it suits this purpose admirable. It is also made into snares for deer and bears; and a good idea may be formed of its strength, when a snare, not thicker than a 16-thread line, is sufficient to strangle Cervus Alces, the Great Stag of California, one of the most powerful animals of its tribe. The cordage is also manufactured into bags and other articles.""",TRUE,FALSE

A fictional character created to bring visual continuity to the marketing of the company's numerous products, Betty Crocker was further developed by Bates, and it was under her direction that the persona of the character flourished, changing from advertising symbol to American cultural icon. Provided the major financial support to fund construction of the Mercedes A. Bates Family Study Center on the OSU campus, which opened in 1992 as the first center in the United States dedicated to studying families during their entire life span. (information obtained from the Oregon State University Alumni Association).""","Public",,,,"Quote from artist on the piece: ""What is a family? In recent years we have had to broaden our definition of this word. In my experience, a family is a very curious, complex and ever changing unit that is composed of many independent and interdependent parts. Sometimes the family acts together, as a single unit, and other times the parts may act completely independently. In some ways, the family is like flowing water, continuous, yet ever changing, never the same. The art work for the Mercedes Bates Family Studies Center addresses these contrasting aspects of the family. [where excerpt on wall next to mural begins] The larger of the two mosaics addresses the security of the home. This piece includes a tall, thin house form that has sprouted roots reaching down into the earth. Contained within the house, a large bird watching over its egg makes reference to the human soul, marriage, and the cycle of life. A ram's head floats above them, also a reference to cycles and regeneration. The tiles around these creatures contain the names of the major donors that have made this building possible, and thoughtful quotes about the family. These names have been permanently fired on to the tile using an overglaze process. Undulating across the roof is a snake. The snake has been used universally as an image of transformation due to its ability to shed its skin. Outside the house, it is a reminder of the forces of change that act upon the family. Ever watchful, above it all is a horned animal, like a goat, the guardian of young life. On the opposite wall is a square mosaic that addresses the dynamic nature of the family. Characters from the larger piece are each in individual boats that are spiralling out from the center where the house is located. The family members are acting individually. Parts of the mosaic are created in low relief using terra cotta clay. This piece of art is inviting to touch, and visitors are welcome to do so. Tile was chosen for its brightness and durability, both of which are important to this site.""",TRUE,FALSE

The compass which forms the base of the piece opens, releasing OSU graduates into five continents and a multitude of professional fields. Images depicted on the nine books include campus scenes, a line from the alma mater, fishing and oceanography, agriculture, athletics and physical fitness, a Native American representation of a beaver, music, science, engineering, and Oregon State's alumni and their new alumni center. Embedded in the base of the compass is a bronze casting of Jim Howland's family compass. Jim is co-founder of CH2M HILL and a member of the art coordinating committee. The art was included in the building as part of the state of Oregon's One Percent for Art program. One percent of the cost of construction of public buildings must be used for art. The materials in TRIBUTE represent Oregon State University as a Land, Sea, and Space Grant Institution. The bronze was created using bark and leaves from Oregon trees. The abstracted water element and five globes representing the five continents were fabricated using enameled and fused glass and hold a gold-leaf shelf in which fiber optic lighting is incorporated.

By day it interacts with and builds on the incoming daylight into the theater foyer and adds a colorful detail to the exterior of the building. By night it casts a vibrant and colorful ambience over the theater foyer and adds a glowing and rich focus to the exterior of the building. On performance nights, Gelwell will welcome theater-goers with its kinetic 'personality.' Inside, the mood will be one of heightened excitement and outside, the message will be sent that 'something is happening here.' Gelwell's pragmatic, minimalistic 'off-the-shelf-store-bought' yet elegant materials pay homage to the production side of theater--with a suggestion of lighting instrumets and lighting gels and a 'behind-the-scenes' feel.

I would take breaks from processing water samples to go out in the cold to sketch and photograph. I was completely entranced by the sea and ice. Back home in my studio, I worked for a year on paintings and pastels from the drawings I did at sea. Then an opportunity came to return to the Southern Ocean. This time we approached the Antarctic from Chile and spent three weeks in the Bransfield Strait. Again I was able to sketch during my breaks and make finished drawings in my cabin in the evenings. After three years, many paintings and various formats to find the best way to express my feelings of being at sea, I painted a series of 36"" square oils on canvas.

,"Montfaucon","oil painting","first floor, main entrance","From Memorial Union art pamphlet: ""What do a World War 1 battlefield in France and the Oregon State University research ship, ""Wecoma,"" in the Pacific Ocean have in common? They are both murals in the Memorial Union rotunda, measuring twenty-one by sixteen feet each and painted by Henk Pander. Pander traveled to Europe in the spring of 1984 to study and photograph the battlefields, and that summer he joined the crew aboard the Wecoma to learn about the university's ocean research. Completed in 1985 after a year and a half in planning and execution, the artist describes his reasoning for juxtaposing these seemingly unrelated subjects: 'One is of land, one of ocean; one faces east, one west; one shows the past, one shows the future. I have set up a situation that shows times, culture, a sense of going forward, and at the same time reminds people what this building really was built for.' This was an Oregon Percent for Art project in conjunction with the remodeling of the Memorial Union which was originally constructed in 1928 in honor of those who had died in World War 1, including Oregon State students. The World War 1 mural is entitled ""Montfaucon,"" the name of a village that was destroyed in the war. The idea came from the image of soldiers gazing up from their trenches, watching dawn creep over their battlefield. No human figures are present, although the memory of human beings long gone pervades the scene. In contrast, the companion work, ""Wecoma,"" bustles with human activiy on the deck of the ship as contemporary Oregon State students participate in research at sea. In this mural, Pander explores the contrast of nature and technology in dramatic terms. For Pander, the frontier of the open sea and the frontier of outer space are linked in the unfathomable vastness and promise of scientific knowledge. When the board of directors of the Memorial Union at OSU selected Pander to paint the huge rotunda murals in 1984, it was his first large-scale mural commission. Painting portraits on commission and creating watercolors for the market are aspects of Pander's money-making enterprise, as are the murals he has painted for private and public sectors. Henk Pander is an artist who supports himself solely by making art and developed his career in Oregon just as the state's Percent for Art legislation was enacted in 1975.""","Public",,,,,TRUE,FALSE
,"Wecoma","oil painting","first floor, main entrance","From Memorial Union art pamphlet: ""Henk Pender was only nine years old with W.W.II came to an end, but his childhood memories of the Netherlands during years of Nazi invasion continue to dominate the war subjects he often paints. Pander immigrated to Oregon in 1967, at the height of US involvement in the Vietnam War, and became 'fascinated by the things that make America America, what makes the rest of the world either enamored or scared of this country.' Pander's work reflects his admiration of art history's Old Masters, such as Peter Bruegel and Frans Hal. His paintings are often graphic, bold, and full of details which have in part contributed to his feelings as an 'outsider' from the painting mainstream in the Pacific Northwest. Nonetheless, his sometimes-controversial career as an artist has been dominated by success. Pander has been commissioned to pain portraits for a variety of local Portland 'celebrities,' and for murals in numerous buildings--including NASA's Galilee space probe at the Jet Propulsion Lab in Pasadena, California.""

Olmsted's 1909 campus plan recommended maintaining the Lower Campus area as a great ""Front Park,"" extending from the college's Ninth Street entrance to its easternmost buildings. The plan for developing Lower Campus as envisioned by Olmsted was begun in the late 1920s by the college's Art and Architecture Department. Around 1920 OSC Presdient WIlliam Jasper Kerr had the colleges's architect, John V. Vennes develop designs for a grand east entrance. W. A. Jensen, the colleges's executive secretary, is credited with conceiving the idea of the gates.In the 1930s, Oregon State College obtained a Federal Works Progress Administration (W.P.A.) grant for designing and building a wrought iron gate for the eastern entrance to campus at Ninth and Madison Streets. The gates were designed by landscape architect F.A. Cuthbert of Eugene and made by Portland artist O. B. Dawson in 1937. They were erected in 1941 after additional funds were raised to complete the installation. The total cost of the project was $15,000. The gates, minus the main gate pieces, were moved to their current location at 11th Street and Madison Avenue in the early 1950s. This view shows Education Hall as seen through one of the Campus Gates' pedestrian entrances.","Please ask at the front desk to view this piece.",,,,,FALSE,FALSE
